# vivo_queries
Write queries to insert into or get data from VIVO

## Purpose
vivo_queries contains a collection of pre-written queries for getting information from your VIVO database or changing the information in your VIVO database without needing to know any SPARQL. Simply fill in the variables specified by the VivoDomainObjects and the query will be written for you (and can be run via the Connection object). By accessing the repo directly, you can also find an added functionality for creating new queries (however, this requires some knowledge of SPARQL).

## Usage
vivo_queries has limited functionality on its own and is meant to be used in conjunction with other programs. [Owls](https://github.com/naomidb/owl-post) is one example, which allows you to manually fill in information for the queries via the command line.
